## Explanation

In order not to violate Instagram's terms of use and end like super well-made apps like [OG App](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378541/the-og-app-instagram-clone-pulled-from-app-store), this app was developed.

In the same manner that anyone could go to [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com) and remove any element via *uBlock* or with *Inspect element*, this app works equally but on Android. 

The app is nothing more than a "Browser" (Firefox/Chrome/Opera...) in which every second it is checked whether there is any component that could lead to non-desired functionalities (such as Foryou page or explore page).

The app is not perfect, I don't know if I can legally add stuff on the HTML, so as of now there is no other way to exit chats but to use the phone's built-in "Back" function.

Finding other users can still be performed by sending them a DM.


## Known issues

* Light mode is the default configuration. Even if changed, once the app is restarted it is restored as default value.
* Cannot exit DM's without phone's built-in "Back" function.
